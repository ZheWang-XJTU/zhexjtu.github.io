I am currently pursuing my Master degree in Applied Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Elite Class) from Xi'an Jiaotong University. I spent some time writing blogs about topics in AI and ML that I am interested in and love discussing open problems with follwers. I am also a big fan of high-tech and always willing to try new Apps on phone and laptop. Outside of academic and research, I like reading biographies of mathematicians and participating  philosophical symposium held by my friends on vacation. I'm learning cooking right now and it seems much more difficult than study!
