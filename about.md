I am currently pursuing my Master degree in Applied Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Elite Class) from Xi'an Jiaotong University. I spent some time working alongside central banks through an 8 month visit in Germany at the Deutsche Bundesbank and with a current research project with the Banco de la Rep&uacute;blica of Colombia.Previously, I did internships in the credit department of Moody's Analytics and in various financial companies, including investment funds. Outside of academic and research, I like reading biographies of mathematicians and participating  philosophical symposium held by my friends in vacation.
