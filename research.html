<strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/v679toklnwtg9tf/paulesoto_jmp.pdf?dl=0">Unrolling FISTA to solve Low-Rank related problems</a></strong> <br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Aided by the accessable of BP Algorithm for SVD operator, it is possible to unroll ISTA for low-rank related problems. To accelerate the convergence rate while avoiding the design of the momentum term manually, We come up with a structure similar to LSTM to learn the momentum term adaptively. This method also gives an inspiration to unroll RPCA into deep neural network by disentangle RPCA into Low-Rank problem and Sparse Problem.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Government regulation requires effective supervision, but regulated entities may window-dress to supervisors.  For empirical identification, we analyze banks exploiting a quasi-natural experiment —ECB’s 2014 asset quality review (AQR)— in conjunction with the security and credit registers.  After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks decrease the share of riskier securities and loans, and level of overall securities and credit supply. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit.  Effects are stronger for banks with higher trading expertise.  Results suggest banks’ window-dressing for supervisory audits, especially on liquid securities that are easier to trade, and hold important implications for supervision.</p><br>
